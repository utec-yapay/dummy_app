# Dummy App
This repository contains a Yape dummy app for YaPay. The app is made with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) and the [barcode scanner plugin](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-barcodescanner). It was made by Alessia Yi and Guillermo Franco, though due to the problems with the NativeScript environment and the nature of the plugin, the team could only work in one computer. 

The app's one and only use is to provide an open source Yape to test the 'Pay with QR' function of the original app, and as such, won't be of much use to the Yape team. Nevertheless, there are small changes to account for the new functionality YaPay is providing.
